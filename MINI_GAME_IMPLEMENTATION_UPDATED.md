# Enhanced Mini-Game Implementation: Musical Notes Game with 3 Difficulty Levels

This document provides an overview of the enhanced implementation of the "Musical Notes Game" mini-game feature with three difficulty levels.

## Implementation Overview

The mini-game allows users to test their musical note knowledge with three progressive difficulty levels:

1. **Level 1 (Visual)**: Look at an image of a musical note and guess its name
2. **Level 2 (Audio)**: Listen to the sound of a musical note and guess its name
3. **Level 3 (Match)**: Listen to the sound of a musical note and select the matching image from multiple choices

Each level increases in difficulty and awards more points for correct answers:
- Level 1: 10 points
- Level 2: 15 points
- Level 3: 20 points

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/index.html` - Updated mini-game card to include difficulty level buttons and enhanced the mini-game modal
2. `frontend/styles.css` - Added new styles for the difficulty levels, enhanced audio player, and multiple-choice options
3. `frontend/script.js` - Updated mini-game functions to handle different difficulty levels and added translations
4. `backend/app.py` - Updated the mini-game routes to support difficulty levels and multiple-choice options

## Directory Structure

The implementation uses the following directory structure for audio files and images:

```
frontend/
└── assets/
    ├── audio/
    │   └── notes/
    │       ├── do.mp3
    │       ├── re.mp3
    │       ├── mi.mp3
    │       ├── fa.mp3
    │       ├── sol.mp3
    │       ├── la.mp3
    │       └── si.mp3
    └── images/
        └── games/
            ├── music-note-thumb.png
            ├── note_do.png
            ├── note_re.png
            ├── note_mi.png
            ├── note_fa.png
            ├── note_sol.png
            ├── note_la.png
            └── note_si.png
```

## Required Files

You need to add the following files:

### Audio Files
Add these MP3 files to the `frontend/assets/audio/notes/` directory:
- `do.mp3`, `re.mp3`, `mi.mp3`, `fa.mp3`, `sol.mp3`, `la.mp3`, `si.mp3`

### Image Files
Add these PNG files to the `frontend/assets/images/games/` directory:
- `music-note-thumb.png` (thumbnail for the mini-game card)
- `note_do.png`, `note_re.png`, `note_mi.png`, `note_fa.png`, `note_sol.png`, `note_la.png`, `note_si.png`

## How It Works

1. The user clicks on one of the three difficulty level buttons on the "Musical Notes Game" card
2. The mini-game modal opens with the appropriate content based on the selected level:
   - Level 1: Shows an image of a musical note
   - Level 2: Shows an audio player to listen to a musical note
   - Level 3: Shows an audio player and multiple-choice options with images
3. The user provides their answer:
   - Levels 1-2: Type the answer in the text input
   - Level 3: Click on one of the multiple-choice options
4. The user clicks the "Submit" button to check their answer
5. If the answer is correct, the user earns points based on the difficulty level and the modal closes after a short delay
6. If the answer is incorrect, the user can try again

## Enhanced UI Features

1. **Improved Audio Player**:
   - Custom-styled play/pause button
   - Progress bar that shows the current playback position
   - Time display showing the current playback time

2. **Multiple-Choice Interface**:
   - Grid layout with images and labels
   - Visual feedback when an option is selected
   - Hover effects for better user experience

3. **Difficulty Level Indicators**:
   - Color-coded difficulty buttons (green for level 1, orange for level 2, red for level 3)
   - Level indicator in the mini-game modal showing the current difficulty level
   - Visual distinction between different game modes

## Testing

To test the mini-game:

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. Open the frontend in a web browser: `http://localhost:5001`
3. Log in to the application
4. Navigate to the mini-games section
5. Click on one of the difficulty level buttons on the "Musical Notes Game" card
6. Test the mini-game functionality for each level

## Notes

- The mini-game uses the existing mini-game infrastructure, so it inherits all the features of the other mini-games
- The audio player is only shown for levels 2-3
- The multiple-choice interface is only shown for level 3
- The points awarded increase with the difficulty level
- The game supports both Vietnamese and English languages
