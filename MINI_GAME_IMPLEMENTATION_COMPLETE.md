# Mini-Game Implementation: Musical Notes Game with 3 Difficulty Levels

This document provides an overview of the completed implementation of the "Musical Notes Game" mini-game feature with three difficulty levels.

## Implementation Overview

The mini-game allows users to test their musical note knowledge with three progressive difficulty levels:

1. **Level 1 (Visual)**: Look at an image of a musical note and guess its name
2. **Level 2 (Audio)**: Listen to the sound of a musical note and guess its name
3. **Level 3 (Match)**: Listen to the sound of a musical note and select the matching image from multiple choices

Each level increases in difficulty and awards more points for correct answers:
- Level 1: 10 points
- Level 2: 15 points
- Level 3: 20 points

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Event Listeners**: Added proper event listeners for mini-game cards and difficulty buttons
2. **Created Complete Question Sets**: Added 10 questions for each difficulty level
3. **Enhanced UI**: Improved the mini-game modal interface with level indicators and better audio controls
4. **Added Multiple Choice Support**: Implemented the multiple-choice interface for level 3
5. **Created Documentation**: Added instructions for adding the necessary audio and image files

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/script.js` - Updated event listeners and mini-game functions
2. `backend/app.py` - Added complete sets of 10 questions for each level

## How It Works

1. The user clicks on one of the three difficulty level buttons on the "Musical Notes Game" card
2. The mini-game modal opens with the appropriate content based on the selected level:
   - Level 1: Shows an image of a musical note
   - Level 2: Shows an audio player to listen to a musical note
   - Level 3: Shows an audio player and multiple-choice options with images
3. The user provides their answer:
   - Levels 1-2: Type the answer in the text input
   - Level 3: Click on one of the multiple-choice options
4. The user clicks the "Submit" button to check their answer
5. If the answer is correct, the user earns points based on the difficulty level and the modal closes after a short delay
6. If the answer is incorrect, the user can try again

## Required Files

For the mini-game to work properly, you need to add the audio and image files as described in the `MINI_GAME_AUDIO_IMAGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.

## Testing

To test the mini-game:

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. Open the frontend in a web browser: `http://localhost:5001`
3. Log in to the application
4. Navigate to the mini-games section
5. Click on one of the difficulty level buttons on the "Musical Notes Game" card
6. Test the mini-game functionality for each level

## Notes

- The mini-game uses the existing mini-game infrastructure, so it inherits all the features of the other mini-games
- The audio player is only shown for levels 2-3
- The multiple-choice interface is only shown for level 3
- The points awarded increase with the difficulty level
- The game supports both Vietnamese and English languages
